## Feedback received 

Good starting place to explain an idea. Have collated feedback and started a new repo for version two as there's a few drastic changes we'll make. :) 

Replaced with https://github.com/leslie-alldridge/tech-voting-v2 as some feedback received and features requested was more suited for a fresh start.
